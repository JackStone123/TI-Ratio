TI-Ratio
========

A quick TI-BASIC script that finds the lowest whole-number ratio of one number to another

Usage
-----

Simply input any two numbers that you would like to find a ratio for, such as 1.5 and 3.  This would return a 1:2 ratio.

Examples
--------

```
.3 and .9: Returns 1:3
500 and 2500: Returns 1:5
400 and 300: Returns 4:3
```
